* Text generation (lorem ipsum): The user specifies how many paragraphs (1-20) of fake latin text to generate.
* Fake user creation: The user specifies how many user names (1-99) to generate. Additionally, the user may select to associate with each fake user a fake birthdate and/or a fake blurb/epitath.
* Demonstrates a basic understanding of Laravel routes, views, templates, and 3rd-pary libraries.
* Demonstrates use of oop principles (in user generation).

## Outside code/resources
* https://github.com/susanBuck/foobooks.git: 'Developer's Best Friend' draws heavily from the lecture example 'foobooks' laravel app. Much of the route syntax, .css, and blade templates are inspired/copied from here.
* https://github.com/samuelwilliams/LoremIpsum: Lorem Ipsum Generator library.
* https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker: General purpose dummy data generator
