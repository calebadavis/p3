## Live URL
<http://p3.prowlers.com>

## Description
* A laravel-based site which generates fake user information, and non-sense text. 
* Text generation (lorem ipsum): The user specifies how many paragraphs (1-20) of fake latin text to generate.
* Fake user creation: The user specifies how many user names (1-99) to generate. Additionally, the user may select to associate with each fake user a fake birthdate and/or a fake blurb/epitath.

## Demo URL
TBD

## Outside code/resources
https://github.com/susanBuck/foobooks.git: Draws heavily from the lecture example 'foobooks' laravel app. Much of the route syntax, .css, and blade templates are inspired/copied from here.
